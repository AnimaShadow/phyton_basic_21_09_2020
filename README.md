# What All Can we Learn From Phyton:-

You may be wondering what all are the applications of Python. There are so many applications of Python, here are some of the them.
1. Web development – Web framework like Django and Flask are based on Python. They help you write server side code which helps you manage database, write backend programming logic, mapping urls etc.

2. Machine learning – There are many machine learning applications written in Python. Machine learning is a way to write a logic so that a machine can learn and solve a particular problem on its own. For example, products recommendation in websites like Amazon, Flipkart, eBay etc. is a machine learning algorithm that recognises user’s interest. Face recognition and Voice recognition in your phone is another example of machine learning.

3. Data Analysis – Data analysis and data visualisation in form of charts can also be developed using Python.

4. Scripting – Scripting is writing small programs to automate simple tasks such as sending automated response emails etc. Such type of applications can also be written in Python programming language.

5. Game development – You can develop games using Python.

6. You can develop Embedded applications in Python.

7. Desktop applications – You can develop desktop application in Python using library like TKinter or QT.

# Installation
You can install Python on any operating system such as Windows, Mac OS X, Linux/Unix and others.

To install the Python on your operating system, go to this link: https://www.python.org/downloads. You will see a screen like this.

This is the official Python website and it will detect the operating system and based on that it would recommend you to download Python. Here I am using Mac OS X so it gave me the download options for Python 2 and Python 3 for Mac OS X. I would recommend you to download the latest version of Python 3
